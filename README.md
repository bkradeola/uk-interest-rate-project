## Executive Summary

Interest rate has been discovered to be one of the factors that determine economic growth and development of a country. This report will be looking at an interest rate dataset gathered from a data warehouse containing the breakdown of interest rate issued periodically for over 100years in the UK. The dataset contains two features (Data and Rate).
However, emphasis will be placed on data from 1982 to 2016 for the purpose of this data analysis

## Objective:

* Mean Interest Rate – 8.10
* MIN Interest rate – 0.25
* MAX Interest Rate – 14.78
* First Quartile – 5.25
* Third Quartile – 11.37
* Lower Range Limit – (3.93)
* Upper Range Limit – 20.55

## Insight Generated:
The Insight generated has been presented in a data visualization format of line graph, bar chart and pie chart for easy visualization and understanding. Also, Slicers are added in order to look at a particular year or quarter at a glance.

The trend generated is a clear indication that interest rate was at its peak in June, 1989 @14.78 and its lowest rate @0.25 in April, 2016.
It was also gathered the trend in the last seven (7) years 2009 to 2016 the trend has been constantly downward below 1% and got to 0.25% as at 2016.
